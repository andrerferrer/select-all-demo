## Goal
This is an app to teach how to create a new user and a nested model in the same form.


### Before we begin, the DB Schema:

A user has many skills and a skill can have many users.

### How to

1. [add the strong_params in the controller](https://github.com/andrerferrer/devise-nested-model-demo/commit/96b6c0d4da118b160c7918db4315c1098c7dbd20)
1. [accept nested attributes for skills](https://github.com/andrerferrer/devise-nested-model-demo/commit/7fdd4efddef6276496ef933bca70843591261f34)
1. [add the input in the form](https://github.com/andrerferrer/devise-nested-model-demo/commit/1f45f2c52a34d2ab5f7413e5527588786b824090)
